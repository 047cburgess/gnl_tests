Is it possible to talk legitimately about a unified Russian “musical aesthetic” within the genre of the nineteenth-century symphony, both in terms of composers’ ideologies, and in the intra-musical processes that they created?
Tchaik 6 & Borodin Prince Igor.




     Tchaikovsky’s claim that ‘Glinka…was the acorn from which the entire oak of Russian music grew’[1] perhaps highlights the influence of Glinka and his ideals upon the Balakirev circle, also known as ‘The Five’, namely Balakirev, Cui, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Borodin. Although George Kauffman has argued that this was perhaps an ‘exaggerated reverence’[2], it cannot be denied that Glinka’s affinity for nationhood in his music shaped the outlook of the next generation of Russian composers. The essence of this nationhood is what separated contemporaries with an ‘ideological split…between a more cosmopolitan and traditional outlook and the “nationalist” outlook’[3], finer details of which were further disputed. Critic Vladimir Stasov further fuelled ‘The Five’ with his aesthetic preferences for realism and nationalism; his appeal for a ‘constant search for national character’[4] was supported by the eighteenth-century influence of Herder, who theorized that ‘folksong…provided the evidence necessary for building up a correct picture of a given nation’s character’[5]. These ideologies resounded clearly at a time of war, notably the French invasion in the Patriotic War of 1812, thus music became another way in which composers could invoke a unity of national spirit. In the same light, Marina Frovola-Walker highlights the concept of Old Europe vs. Young Russia; the Russian musical aesthetic developed the stance that their lack of formal training released them from the ‘trodden over’[6] path of European, namely Germanic traditions and formal structures. However, the insertion of traditional folksong – which bore a similar ‘tragic soul’ as that present in Russian discourse - as a way of validating one’s music as authentically ‘Russian’ ultimately resulted in something quite different; the developing orientalism as a result of these nationalistic elements projected the lively, colourful spirit we have come to associate with Russian music today. Here I shall assess how successfully this ambition of a unified Russian musical aesthetic was realized, focusing on Borodin’s Prince Igor [and Tchaikovsky’s ‘Pathétique’ Symphony]. 
     Borodin’s Prince Igor signifies what the Russians considered as unique to their musical output: the creation of an “epic” in nationalism. Described by Kauffman as ‘the first Russian heroic-epic opera’[7], it is considered to represent nineteenth-century philosophy in musical form in terms of its nationalism and realism. Despite Richard Taruskin’s inherent need to polemicize, I would argue his opinion that ‘the opera boiled down to certain levels of Kitschism’[8] is invalid and loses sight of the essence of Borodin’s style and what he sought to represent. Gerald Abraham was more accurate when he described the disconnected scenes of Prince Igor as a ‘stage picture’[9]; the individual scenes, though arguably lacking in flow or plot, give the overriding impression of an animated setting. Thus this satisfies Borodin’s intention to draw in ‘bold strokes’[10], depicting the realism of one’s environment in a different way to painting and literature; it is a ‘grand picture-book’[11] and an epic. Kauffman asserts this when he argues that ‘the epic is thus an especially congenial genre for the nationalist, who wishes to capture and portray the character of a people rather than that of individuals’[12]. As ‘larger-than-life figures who represent tribes, nation, religious groups and the like’[13], the ‘epic’ of Prince Igor reflects the German Biedermeier aesthetic of Tableaux-Vivants; Prince Igor is arguably a personification of a Tableaux-Vivants, combining music, landscape and issues of nationhood in a manner comparable to the German Diorama. Thus this particular aspect cannot be claimed as innately ‘Russian’ as it stems from the German school of Beethoven with the ‘Eroica’, Mendelssohn’s ‘Scottish’ and Schumann’s ‘Rheinish’, all of which portray nationhood through the invocation of landscape, the picturesque and a sense of the Epic. 
     It is crucial to touch upon the 1812 Patriotic War, as this is what prioritized a unity of nationhood in order to appear united before Napoleon. Herder’s influence in this matter was an additional force to Stasov, both theorizing that traditional Russian folksong was essential in image-making as a vehicle of propaganda. Stasov realized that Russian high-culture as it stood was no different to that of Europe, thus sought to exploit the lives of the lower classes, the peasants, as a means of national identity; ‘The protyazhnaya came to be seen as a paradigm for all Russian folksong, or even as the essence of Russian creativity and the “Russian soul” itself.’[14] Peasants therefore roused a ‘wave of patriotism through the Moscow high society’[15] and an image of Russia was formed drawn from their rejection of European values.’
     Taruskin argues that Borodin’s ‘exotic idiom…[is] the one most instantly identifiable as his’[16]. By this Taruskin refers to what is more commonly considered as ‘orientalism’, a hallmark in the ‘Russian’ style of ‘The Five’. This is where Russian folk-song, and Eastern folk-song in general, became an instantly identifiable way of portraying Russian roots; ‘the sultry nega music in the middle acts…epitomized not just the East but the seductive, erotic East that emasculates, enslaves, and renders passive.’[17] Russian folk-song itself is melodically rich and encompasses a shared repetitive nature with that found in oriental music. The cyclical treatment of motif with a narrow range is demonstrated in Example 1, and is exemplary of the “Russian sound”; the upper melody encompasses a range of just a 4th, and the cellos only exceed a major 2nd to a major 3rd in the fifth bar. However, when the exoticism came into play on the stage, the ‘tragic soul’ initially suggested by these elements of narrow, repetitive melody became outshone by the theatrical costumes on stage. As became to be the case, though, these folk-song ‘insertions’ sounded anything but melancholy in the context of their symphonies or operas; ‘this music was itself heard as bright, decorative, exotic and fantastic; no Russian tragic soul was in view.’[18] Thus the music of Borodin became associated with elements of the production, and the ‘Russianness’ employed through the use of folksong was not what ultimately contributed to the perceived Russian style.
     In the case of Tchaikovsky, however, he has long been criticized as ‘more cosmopolitan than his compatriots, more deeply influenced by the classic form, and less a devotee of the national music.’[19] I would argue that it was Tchaikovsky’s affinity for operatic styles in an equal measure to his symphonies that gave him the tendency to place a greater emphasis on melodic line than his contemporaries. Critic Stasov said that his ‘musical nature lacked the national element’[20]
